## 6.0.0 (2022-08-05)
- Big breaking change to the `[ValidateRequest]` attribute. The attribute no longer accepts parameters nor properties. Instead, you have to configure the request validation as documented in the readme.
- You can now add the Twilio REST client to ASP.NET Core's dependency injection container, using the `.AddTwilioClient` method. This Twilio client will use an `HttpClient` provided by an HTTP client factory. See readme for more details.
- We no longer try to match the Twilio SDK version number, and instead go by our own versioning to better communicate breaking changes vs minor changes.
- The projects are now built and packages are now pushed using GitHub Actions instead of AppVeyor.
- The projects are now built deterministically and support source link for better debugging.
- More samples have been added to the readme.

Read about these changes in more detail at the [v6 announcement post](https://www.twilio.com/blog/whats-new-in-twilio-helper-library-for-aspnet-v6).
